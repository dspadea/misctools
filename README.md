# Misctools

This repository contains a collection of miscellaneous tools and utilities, organized by topic. 

## Use at your own risk. 

These are tools for my own use that I'm making available in the hopes that others find them useful too, even as a starting point or reference.
They have not been thoroughly tested outside of my own use cases. Make sure to review and understand each tool before using it, as it may not work 
on your system without modification. 

## Usage & Installation

For instructions on installation and usage, please refer to the README file in each tool's directory. Each directory provides specific guidance relevant to its scripts and utilities.

## Structure

Tools are grouped by topic in subdirectories (e.g., `aws/`, `bluetooth/`, `k8s-snap/`).
